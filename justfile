#
# A "justfile" is a list of commands you can run with `just <name>`.
# Think of it as a project's command center — instead of remembering
# `uv run pytest -v`, you just type `just test`.
#
# Why use just instead of make? It is simpler, cross-platform,
# and the syntax is easier to read.
#
# Show all commands:    `just`
# Run a command:        `just <name>`     (e.g. `just setup`)

# Export every variable defined here as an environment variable for
# the recipes that just runs.
set export
# On Linux/macOS, run recipe lines with bash and -u (error on
# unset variables) and -c (read commands from a string).
set shell := ["bash", "-uc"]
# On Windows, fall back to PowerShell with no logo / non-interactive.
set windows-shell := ["powershell.exe", "-NoLogo", "-Command"]
# Make recipe arguments available to shebang scripts as `$1`, `$2`,
# `$@`, and `$#`. Without this, shebang recipes only see args via the
# textual `{{args}}` substitution, which is unsafe for inputs that
# contain `$` (the substituted text gets re-expanded by bash).
set positional-arguments

# Show available commands when you run `just` with no args.
default:
    @just --list --unsorted

# Setup Commands

# One-shot first-time setup — creates .venv and installs everything
[group('setup')]
setup:
    @echo "Creating virtual environment with uv..."
    # uv venv creates a .venv/ folder using the system Python that
    # matches `requires-python` in pyproject.toml.
    # --allow-existing makes the recipe safe to re-run after a partial install.
    uv venv --allow-existing
    @echo ""
    @echo "Installing dependencies (including dev tools)..."
    # --all-extras pulls in every optional-dependencies group (just `dev`
    # for us). Without this, dev tools like pytest do not get installed.
    uv sync --all-extras
    @echo ""
    @echo "✓ Setup complete!"
    @echo ""
    @echo "Try it out:"
    @echo "  just run -- https://example.com"

# Install runtime dependencies only (no dev tools)
[group('setup')]

# =============================================================================
# Testing & Quality Checks
# =============================================================================

# Run the test suite
[group('test')]
test:
    @echo "Running tests..."
    # `uv run` runs a command inside the project's virtual environment
    # without us having to `source .venv/bin/activate` first.
    uv run pytest

# Run all linters in sequence (ruff + pylint + mypy)
[group('test')]

    @echo "=== Ruff ==="
    uv run ruff check http_headers_scanner.py test_http_headers_scanner.py

    @echo "=== Mypy ==="
    uv run mypy http_headers_scanner.py
    @echo ""
    @echo "✓ All linters passed"

# Auto-format every Python file with yapf
[group('test')]
format:
    @echo "Formatting code with yapf..."
    # -i = in place. Edits the files directly instead of printing diffs.
    uv run yapf -i http_headers_scanner.py test_http_headers_scanner.py

# Auto-fix what ruff can fix on its own (unused imports, etc.)
[group('test')]

    uv run ruff check http_headers_scanner.py test_http_headers_scanner.py --fix


# =============================================================================
# Run the CLI
# =============================================================================

# Run headers — pass the URL after `--`
# Example:  just run -- https://example.com
#           just run -- https://github.com --timeout 5
# [no-exit-message] silences just's "Recipe `run` failed with exit
# code N" line when the scanner exits non-zero. The scanner uses
# exit 1 for grade C/D and exit 2 for grade F or network error —
# meaningful CI signals, not "the recipe is broken." The exit code
# itself is still propagated to whoever invoked just.
[group('run')]
[no-exit-message]
run *args:
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    # If no args were given, print a friendly usage block and exit
    # cleanly. Without this, `just run` (no args) would invoke
    # `uv run headers` with nothing, argparse would exit 2, and just
    # would tack a "Recipe `run` failed" error on top — confusing for
    # someone just trying to see how the command works.
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
        cat <<'EOF'
    Usage: just run -- <url> [options]

    Examples:
      just run -- https://example.com
      just run -- https://github.com --timeout 5

    See all options:
      just run -- --help
    EOF
        exit 0
    fi
    # Forward args via "$@" — NOT via {{args}}. Why: {{args}} is a
    # TEXTUAL substitution done by just before bash runs the script,
    # so a URL or option value with $ in it would get those $-references
    # expanded as bash variables and arrive at the headers CLI mangled.
    # "$@" hands bash the original argv unchanged.
    uv run headers "$@"
