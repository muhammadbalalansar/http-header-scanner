http_headers_scanner.py

Scan a URL and grade its HTTP security headers A–F

When a browser asks a website for a page, the server sends back the
page itself PLUS a bunch of metadata called "HTTP response headers."
Some of those headers are security-critical: they tell the browser
"only talk to me over HTTPS," "do not let other sites embed me in
an iframe," "ignore guesses about file types," and more

If a website forgets these headers, real attacks become easier:
clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, mixed-content downgrades, XSS that
otherwise would have been stopped by a good Content-Security-Policy.
This script connects to a URL, pulls the headers, and tells you which
ones are missing or weak

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The headers we care about
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Strict-Transport-Security  forces HTTPS for return visits
  Content-Security-Policy    controls which scripts/styles may load
  X-Content-Type-Options     disables MIME-sniffing
  X-Frame-Options            controls iframe embedding (clickjacking)
  Referrer-Policy            limits Referer leakage
  Permissions-Policy         disables browser features the page does
                             not need (camera, microphone, etc.)

Each rule has a severity (high / medium / low). The score is the
percentage of weighted points the site earned. The grade comes from
the score: 90+ A, 80+ B, 70+ C, 60+ D, otherwise F. This mirrors the
model used by the Mozilla Observatory

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What this script does NOT do
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  - It does not crawl the site, only the URL you give it
  - It does not parse complex CSP directives (just checks presence)
  - It does not test for actual XSS or open redirects

This is foundational: learn the headers, then graduate to bigger
tools like Mozilla Observatory or `securityheaders.com`

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What this file exposes
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  HeaderRule        — one rule (header name, severity, description, ...)
  HeaderFinding     — the result of evaluating one rule
  ScanReport        — full report (url, status_code, findings, score, grade)
  evaluate_header() — run one rule against a set of headers
  scan()            — fetch a URL and run every rule
  main()            — CLI entry point used by `headers <url>`
