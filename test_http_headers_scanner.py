test_http_headers_scanner.py

Tests for http_headers_scanner — covers rule evaluation, the score
calculation, grade thresholds, and a mocked end-to-end scan

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
What "tests" are and why we write them
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A test is a tiny Python function that calls our real code with a
known input and then ASSERTS that the result is what we expected.
If the assertion fails, pytest prints a red FAIL message — which
means we changed something and broke a behavior we cared about

Tests are insurance. The first time you write the code, the test
just confirms it works. But six months later when you refactor or
add a new feature, the existing tests catch any accidental breakage

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why we mock the network with respx
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
A test that hits a real website is FRAGILE. The site might be down,
slow, redesigned, or behind a captcha. None of that has anything to
do with whether OUR code is correct

`respx` is a library that intercepts httpx calls and returns a
canned response we control. So when we test scan("https://test"),
respx hands back EXACTLY the headers we tell it to — letting us
verify the scanning logic without touching the network

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Coverage strategy
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
We exercise each branch of the code at least once

  - evaluate_header: ok / weak / missing / case-insensitive lookup
  - ScanReport.score: all-ok, all-missing, mixed
  - ScanReport.grade: each band (A, B, C, D, F)
  - scan(): full pipeline against a mocked response, including a redirect

That is enough confidence — adding ten variations of "another header"
would not catch any new bugs
